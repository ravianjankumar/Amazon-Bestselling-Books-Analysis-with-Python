# Jupyter Notebook Project

## Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates Python code through a series of 6 code cells. While the notebook currently lacks markdown explanations, it appears to involve code examples or experiments that you can explore and build upon.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries (install using pip):
  
```bash
